## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Script references are missing"
**Solution**: Let Unity compile all scripts first (takes 1-2 minutes)

### "Scene is empty"
**Solution**: Make sure you opened `MainGame.unity` in Scenes folder

### "Prefab references are None"
**Solution**: You need to create hex tile prefabs and assign them

### "Compile errors"
**Solution**: 
1. Install Newtonsoft.Json: `Window → Package Manager → + → Add package from git URL → com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json`
2. Let Unity recompile
